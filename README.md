# Boston-Housing-ML
A machine learning project using the Boston Housing dataset. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression models to predict housing prices.
- The Boston Housing dataset includes a variety of socioeconomic and structural features that influence housing prices in the Boston area.
- Key predictors include CRIM (per capita crime rate by town), which may negatively impact property values, and ZN (proportion of residential land zoned for large lots), often associated with wealthier neighborhoods.
- INDUS reflects the proportion of land devoted to non-retail business, which can indicate urban density. CHAS is a binary variable indicating proximity to the Charles River, a desirable location for many.
- NOX measures air pollution, which tends to decrease property value. RM, the average number of rooms per dwelling, is a strong positive indicator of price. AGE indicates the proportion of older homes; older housing stock may affect appeal and maintenance costs.
- DIS measures access to employment centers, where greater distance can lower prices. RAD and TAX relate to transportation accessibility and property tax rates, respectively, influencing affordability and desirability. PTRATIO captures the student-to-teacher ratio, reflecting education quality, while B represents a demographic index.
- LSTAT measures the percentage of lower-income residents and typically has a negative correlation with home value. Finally, MEDV is the target variable representing the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.
